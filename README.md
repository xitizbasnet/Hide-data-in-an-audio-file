Hello my little Freaks. We  looked at a method for hiding files in a picture, and this time we will show you a method for hiding data in audio files.

 Let's get started:

 1. Download and install DeepSound - http://jpinsoft.net/DeepSound/Download.aspx

 2. Open the program and click on "Open carrier files", then specify the path where the audio file is stored, where the information will be hidden.

 3. Click on "Add secret files" and select the required data.

 4. Next click on "Encode secret files".

 The files were hidden in the "music".  In order to get them out of there, on the main page of the program, add the audio file in which the data was encrypted and click on "Extract secret files".

 Done!  Now you know another method for storing important information securely.
